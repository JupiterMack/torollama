# Security Guidelines for TorOllama MCP Server

## Overview

TorOllama MCP Server provides TOR network connectivity for AI models, enabling anonymous web requests and access to hidden services. This document outlines important security considerations, best practices, and guidelines for safe usage.

## ⚠️ Important Security Warnings

### Legal Compliance
- **Know Your Laws**: TOR usage may be restricted or illegal in some jurisdictions
- **Corporate Policies**: Check your organization's policies before deployment
- **Content Responsibility**: You are responsible for all content accessed through this server
- **No Illegal Activity**: This tool is intended for legitimate privacy and research purposes only

### Technical Limitations
- **Not a Complete Anonymity Solution**: TOR provides network-level anonymity but doesn't protect against all tracking methods
- **Exit Node Trust**: Clearnet traffic relies on TOR exit nodes which may monitor unencrypted traffic
- **Traffic Analysis**: Sophisticated adversaries may still perform traffic correlation attacks
- **Browser Fingerprinting**: Application-level fingerprinting is not prevented by network anonymization

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Network Configuration

#### TOR Configuration
```bash
# Use secure TOR configuration
SocksPort 9050 IsolateDestAddr IsolateDestPort
ControlPort 9051
CookieAuthentication 1
DisableDebuggerAttachment 0
```

#### Firewall Rules
```bash
# Block direct connections, force through TOR
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j REJECT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j REJECT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 9050 -j ACCEPT
```

### 2. Application Security

#### Environment Isolation
- Run the MCP server in a containerized environment
- Use separate user account with minimal privileges
- Isolate from other network services

#### Data Handling
- **No Persistent Logging**: The server doesn't log request contents by default
- **Memory Clearance**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory after use
- **Temporary Files**: Avoid writing sensitive data to disk

#### Configuration Security
```json
{
  "torConfig": {
    "socksPort": 9050,
    "controlPort": 9051,
    "dataDirectory": "/secure/path/tor-data",
    "circuitBuildTimeout": 60,
    "newCircuitPeriod": 30
  }
}
```

### 3. AI Model Integration

#### Prompt Safety
- Sanitize AI model inputs that might contain sensitive information
- Be cautious about AI models learning from TOR-accessed content
- Consider using separate AI instances for TOR-based requests

#### Content Filtering
- Implement content filtering for inappropriate or illegal material
- Monitor and log access patterns (without storing content)
- Set up alerts for suspicious activity patterns

## Privacy Protection Measures

### 1. Circuit Management
```javascript
// Regularly rotate TOR circuits
await torClient.newCircuit();

// Use different circuits for different purposes
const isolatedClient = new TorNetworkClient({
  socksPort: 9060,  // Different port for isolation
  controlPort: 9061
});
```

### 2. Request Sanitization
- Remove identifying headers from HTTP requests
- Use generic User-Agent strings
- Avoid sending cookies or authentication tokens

### 3. DNS Protection
- All DNS requests are routed through TOR
- Use .onion addresses when possible
- Avoid DNS leaks through proper SOCKS configuration

## Operational Security (OPSEC)

### 1. Deployment Security

#### Production Deployment
```yaml
# Docker Compose example
version: '3.8'
services:
  torollama:
    build: .
    network_mode: "none"
    volumes:
      - tor-data:/app/tor-data:ro
    environment:
      - TOR_SOCKS_PORT=9050
      - TOR_CONTROL_PORT=9051
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add:
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE
```

#### Monitoring
- Monitor TOR connection health
- Track circuit creation frequency
- Alert on connection failures
- Log security-relevant events (without content)

### 2. Maintenance Security

#### Regular Updates
- Keep TOR client updated to latest stable version
- Update Node.js and dependencies regularly
- Monitor security advisories for dependencies

#### Backup Security
- Encrypt any configuration backups
- Don't backup TOR data directories
- Securely dispose of old configuration files

## Threat Model Considerations

### 1. Network-Level Threats
- **Traffic Analysis**: Sophisticated adversaries may correlate traffic patterns
- **Exit Node Compromise**: Malicious exit nodes may monitor clearnet traffic
- **Circuit Compromise**: Some circuits may be compromised by adversaries

### 2. Application-Level Threats
- **Side-Channel Attacks**: Timing attacks may reveal information
- **Memory Dumps**: Sensitive data in memory could be extracted
- **Log Analysis**: Even non-content logs may reveal patterns

### 3. Infrastructure Threats
- **Host Compromise**: If host system is compromised, TOR protection is bypassed
- **Container Escape**: Container vulnerabilities may expose host system
- **Supply Chain**: Compromised dependencies could introduce vulnerabilities

## Incident Response

### 1. Compromise Detection
```bash
# Check for unexpected network connections
netstat -tulpn | grep -E ':(9050|9051)'

# Monitor TOR logs for anomalies
tail -f /var/log/tor/tor.log | grep -i error

# Check system integrity
aide --check
```

### 2. Response Procedures
1. **Immediate**: Disconnect from network
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope of compromise
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Recovery**: Restore from known-good state
5. **Lessons Learned**: Update security measures

### 3. Evidence Preservation
- Preserve system state for forensic analysis
- Document timeline of events
- Coordinate with legal team if required

## Compliance Considerations

### 1. Data Protection
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- Privacy policy transparency
- Data minimization principles
- User consent mechanisms

### 2. Industry Standards
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Implement defense-in-depth strategies
- Regular security assessments
- Penetration testing
